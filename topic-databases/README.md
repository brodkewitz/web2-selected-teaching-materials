## Notes

After introducing the topic and concepts, this demo gives students the opportunity to see and execute several examples of SQL queries.

For some fun data to work with, we utilize [Exportify](https://exportify.net/) to export whatever parts of our music libraries we're comfortable sharing. I do some quick manual work on the csv data, and create a SQLite database for everyone to download and follow along with on their own computers.

Typing queries can be tedious and error prone, so I provide them in the lecture pages on Canvas to copy.
