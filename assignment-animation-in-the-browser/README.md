## Notes

After an introductory demo, this project is the students' first experience working with SVG and GSAP.

Students love this project. Their content is all original, they get to be creative, and the animations are fun and whimsical. There are a lot of steps involved in preparing the vector graphics for export, inlining, and animating, before they even get to the animation code itself. I'm consistently impressed with their results!
